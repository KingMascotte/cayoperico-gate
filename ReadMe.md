# Introduction

This is a very basic ymap that removes the exterior and interior gates at the large villa on Cayo Perico making it accessible by foot & vehicle - replacing it with a steel security gate.

## Requirements

- Cayo Perico Map


## Installation


### Step 1

Ideally, you should put the contents of the stream folder into an existing map resource as it makes no sense for something this small to be ran as a single resource. 
If you are using [Dopes Island Hopper](https://forum.cfx.re/t/dope-island-hopper-hop-between-los-santos-and-cayo-perico-island/1915671) then skip to step 3. 

### Step 2

If you're using a map mod such as [This one made by Hai_tux](https://forum.cfx.re/t/the-cayo-perico-island-available-for-fivem/1897446) - then you'll need to copy the contents of the stream
folder to the stream folder of the Island to prevent any issues with duplicate props loading.

### Step 3

All done. This isn't by any means pretty or something that was made with a lot of effort, as such it won't be updated, ever. If you wish to use a different exterior or whatever, then 
follow one of the many tutorials on youtube on how to use [Codewalker](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/codewalker-gtav-interactive-3d-map), the tool which was used to make this ymap.
